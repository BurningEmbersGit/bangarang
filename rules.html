  <h1>Rules</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Place the cards somewhere everyone can reach</li>
    <li>The most chaotic player goes first</li>
    <li>The active player picks up a card (if you don't like it, just take
      another) and reads out the questions one at a time
    </li>
    <li>The other players have to guess what the active player's answer to the
      question would be. If you've got an unfair advantage, guess last.
    </li>
    <li>The active player reveals their answer. Repeat this for the remaining
      questions on the card.
    </li>
    <li>Then the person to the active player's left becomes the active player.</li>
    <li><b>Scoring:</b> If you want, keep track of how many guesses everyone
      gets right. The best guesser wins.
    </li>
    <li>The rules are made up! If you want, make up you're own (and if they're
      cool, tell me about it!)
    </li>
  </ol>
